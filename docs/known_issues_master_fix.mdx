## Menu width of DropdownMenu does not match the width of the input field.
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.32.0 up to at least 3.35.1.</Error>
<Info>Has a theme default **fix** in FlexColorScheme 8.3.0 and later.</Info>

The width of the DropdownMenu no longer by default matches the width of the dropdown input field. This is
a regression bug in Flutter SDK that was introduced in version 3.32.0.
See issue [#111828](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/170970). Has a fix in master via [#PR 135751](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/135751), but it has not landed in Flutter 3.35 stable.

FlexColorScheme version 8.3.0 includes a built-in workaround for this issue that will be used until the FIX PR is merged into the stable channel.
