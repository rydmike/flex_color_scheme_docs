# Sponsors

If you like using [**FlexColorScheme**](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_scheme) or my other Flutter packages, like for example, [**FlexColorPicker**](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_color_picker) and [**FlexSeedScheme**](https://pub.dev/packages/flex_seed_scheme), or any other of my open source work, you can sponsor me on [**GitHub here**](https://github.com/sponsors/rydmike). **FlexColorScheme** and its companion app the **Themes Playground** is free to use. Sponsorship is totally optional, but very welcome! üíô

## GitHub Sponsors

I'm pleased and honored to list and mention my sponsors. Sponsorship on GitHub helps me maintain FlexColorScheme and my other open-source repositories. It also encourages me to continue their development. Thank you for your support! üòÉüôè
