# Fixed in Stable

The issues below have a fix that has **landed in the latest stable hotfix or earlier** version of Flutter.

The status of fixes to known issues is typically reviewed when a new stable release lands.

This list is included to show what older versions of Flutter the theming fixes do not apply to.
Prefer using the latest stable version of Flutter to benefit from all fixes listed below.

## Flutter 3.27 and later breaks past styling and theming of icon color on buttons with icons
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.32.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter stable 3.27 and 3.29.</Error>

When you theme or style a `FilledButton.icon`, `ElevatedButton.icon`, `OutlinedButton.icon`, `TextButton.icon` or a `SegmentedButton` with icons, and give them a foreground color, the text color and the used icon color should both use the specified foreground color. This was the case in all versions prior to Flutter 3.27.0. In Flutter 3.27.0 and 3.29 the styling and theming is broken and the icon color keep default colors.

For more information, see issue [#162839](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/162839). This issue was fixed in [PR 162880](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/162880) and landed in Flutter stable 3.29.

## Cannot theme progress indicators, many properties missing
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.29.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter stable 3.27 and earlier.</Error>
The `ProgressIndicatorThemeData` is missing many key properties from `LinearProgressIndicator` and `CircularProgressIndicator` making it impossible to theme their styles. For more information, see issue [#131690](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/131690). This issue was fixed in [PR 158104](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/158104) and landed in Flutter stable 3.29.

## SegmentedButton OverlayColor MaterialState incorrectly set
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.27.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.24 and earlier.</Error>
The SegmentedButton sets its `MaterialState` incorrectly for `overlayColor` in its used `ButtonStyleButton` segments. See issue [123308](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123308). Reported as probably fixed by [PR](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/159072), which landed in Flutter 3.27.

## DropdownMenu themed focused item broken
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.27.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.13 and earlier.</Error>
The style indication of the found and focused/selected item in a `DropdownMenu` does not use `MenuButtonThemeData`. Its simulation of the focused state omits the theme. This makes it impossible to provide a consistent style for the focused/selected item when using a custom theme in a `DropdownMenu`. We have to use the default style for the entire menu, or accept a deviant and out-of-style looking focused/selected item. For more information, see issue [#123736](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123736). This issue was fixed in [PR 153159](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/153159) and landed in Flutter stable 3.27.

## SegmentedButton height does not match Material3 spec and cannot be changed
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.22.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.19 and earlier.</Error>
The Material-3 specification gives a height of 40 dp for Segmented buttons and a recommended `TapTargetSize` of 48 dp. This cannot be achieved in Flutter since the `minimumSize` style-property does not affect the widget. The correct minimumSize was actually set as default value in [PR #120095](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/120095), but is not honored, see issue [#121493](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/121493). This was fixed in [PR ](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/142243) that landed in Flutter stable 3.22, maybe already in 3.19.

## Chips, passed in iconTheme is not applied
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.19.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.16 and earlier.</Error>
When passing in `iconTheme` to `Chip`, `ActionChip`, `ChoiceChip`, `FilterChip` or `InputChip`, it is not applied. See issue [#111828](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/111828). Was fixed via [#PR 135751](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/135751), that landed in Flutter 3.19.

## TextStyles in Menus do not follow Material-3 spec
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.16.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter stable 3.13 and earlier.</Error>
Based on Material-3 specification menus should use text style `labelLarge` (M3 14 dp) for its menu items. For a `Textfield` part in a dropdown menu, the default for `Textfield` should be used, which is `bodyLarge` (M3 16 dp). The menus currently do not always use these correct Material-3 defaults.
For more information, see issue [#131676](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/131676), fixed by [PR #131930](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/131930).

## DropdownButtonFormField input decorator focus/hover is not clipped
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.16.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.13 and earlier.</Error>
When using an input decorator theme in `ThemeData`, the form field of the `DropdownButtonFormField` gets the correct themed result, but the shape is not clipped based on used radius of the input decorator for focused and hovered states.
For more information, see issue [#131282](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/131282), fixed via [PR #131481](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/131481).

## TimePicker clock-dial has wrong M3 defaults
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.16.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.13 and earlier.</Error>
<Info>Always had a theme default **fix** in FlexColorScheme, this was never an issue when using FlexColorScheme.</Info>
The `TimePicker` clock-dial uses wrong spec color, and its M3 web spec has a mistake.
See issue [#118657](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/118657), fixed by [PR #131045](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/131045)

## DropdownMenu leading icon usage layout issue
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.16.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter stable 3.13 and earlier.</Error>
When using a leading icon in a `DropdownMenu` in the entry field, the menu nicely automatically aligns the text in the menu entry field, with the text part in the dropdown menu entries, shown when it is opened. However, if we also add a `leadingIcon` to a `DropdownMenuEntry`, we also get the extra leading space and things do not line up.
For more information, see issue [#131350](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/131350), fixed by [PR #135004](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/135004).

## Chips umbrella issue
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.16.</Success>
<Warning>Applies to Flutter 3.13 and earlier.</Warning>
The `Chip` does not conform to Material3 design spec when `useMaterial3` is enabled. See umbrella issue [#115364](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/115364) for details.

The theme related issues listed in the Chips umbrella issue have been fixed since **Flutter 3.13**. **However**, some of the **Chips theming limitation issues** will need further investigation and still appears to apply when theming Chips. New issue(s) demonstrating remaining theming limitations will need to be created to get them addressed. One of the issues listed issues in the `Chip` umbrella issue is still open, but considering the main issues in it closed and will track new specific issues via new issues.

## NavigationDrawer selected item has wrong icon color
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.13.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter stable 3.10 and earlier.</Error>
The default color of the icon on a selected item in `NavigationDrawer` does not follow Material3 spec.
Based on [published spec](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-drawer/specs) the color should
in Flutter be `ColorScheme.onSecondaryContainer`. For more information, see issue [#129572](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/129572). Fixed via [PR #129625](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/129625).

## SearchBar InputDecorator issue
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.13.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter stable 3.10.</Error>
The `SearchAnchor.bar` picks up app InputDecorator theme, and it cannot be removed.
For more information, see issue [#126623](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/126623).
Fixed via [PR #127465](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/127465).

## DatePicker divider issue
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.13.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter stable 3.10.</Error>
DatePicker Divider cannot be removed or styled, it does not fit with a custom header background.
For more information, see issue [#126597](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/126597).
Fixed via [PR #127197](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/127197).

## Chips state elevation issues in M3
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.13.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7 and 3.10.</Error>
Some `Chip` variants in M3 should have state elevations when interacted with, they do not. See issue [#115825](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/115825). Fixed via [PR #128049](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/128049). Unverified if the fix is 100% correct based on M3 Web spec (like dragged elevations) and all the Chip variants elevations, but it is definitely much better.

## Chips missing pressed/splash effects on actionable Chips in M3
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.13.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7 and 3.10.</Error>
No ink splashes on actionable `Chips` when using color on them. See issue [#115824](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/115824). The ink effects get covered by color on the used `Material` the button is constructed off.
Fixed via [PR #124673](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/124673).

## Chips background cannot be state adaptive
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.13.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7 and 3.10.</Error>
When creating a Chip, cannot set different background color for each different material state.
Has fix [PR #128584](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/128584) in **stable 3.13**.
It is uncertain if the fix can be used with themes for each Chip variant, it will work well on Chip property level though.

## SliverAppBar.medium and SliverAppBar.large Theming and Default Values Issue
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.13.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7 and 3.10.</Error>
The `AppBar`'s foreground theme color, from theme or widget foreground color properties are **not applied** to action icon color for `SliverAppBar.medium` and `SliverAppBar.large`. The defaults for M2 foreground color on a `SliverAppBar.medium` and `SliverAppBar.large` are **incorrect** in **light theme** mode when using **Material-2**. For more information, see issue [#123943](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123943).
Fixed via [PR #123293](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/122542).

## MenuButton text animates on hover/focus/press state
<Success>Not an issue, can be theme solved.</Success>
This issue is actually not a Flutter issue. Turns out the text animation of `MenuButton` items when using inverse text color on selected item, compared to unselected items, **can** be removed with a `ButtonStyle` property on `MenuButtonThemeData`. FlexColorScheme version 7.2 added this setting to FIX this issue. In FCS 7.1 and earlier, the issue still exists.
**Original issue text was:** A menu selection label is not supposed to animate when it is highlighted, nor does it do so on icons in the menu, only on the text. For more information, see issue [#23615](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123615).

## DropdownMenu's menu overlay size issue
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7.</Error>
If a `DropdownMenu` is placed in a `ListView`, the menu overlay expands to the width of the layout. This is a minor issue. You can work around it by placing the `DropdownMenu` e.g. in a `Column` in the `ListView`. Interestingly, when opening a menu overlay from a `MenuBar` or the `MenuAnchor`, even when they are placed in a `ListView`, they do not exhibit this behavior. Neither does `DropdownMenu`, if it is in a `Column`. For more information, see issue [#123631](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123631).

## InputChip, a disabled selected InputChip has wrong color in M3
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7.</Error>
Wrong selected plus disabled `InputChip` color used in M3, see issue [#115826](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/115826).
A fix exists in master, but based on an initial view of the fix, the fix may still suffer from unexpected results when theming Chips. It will need to be further investigated, and a new issue opened if that is the case. Has a **fix** [PR #120192](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/120192) in master, is now in 3.10 stable.

## SegmentedButton segments background cannot be made transparent
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7.</Error>
The Material-3 specification depicts `SegmentedButton` unselected button segments, as having transparent color, used to show background color of surface it is placed upon. This is needed for it to work well on elevation-tinted surfaces in Material-3 design. See issue [#123292](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123292), it has a merged fix in beta 3.10 and master via [PR #123293](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/123293).

## SegmentedButton has wrong M3 defaults
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7.</Error>
<Info>Has a theme default **fix** in FlexColorScheme v7, so this is not an issue when using FlexColorScheme.</Info>
The `SegmentedButton` uses wrong default color for unselected item color, it uses `primary` color, it should be `onSurface`. See issue [# 119733](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/119733) for more information. FCS7 includes a theme fix for this working already in Flutter 3.7. Has a **fix** [PR #120095](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/120095) in beta 3.10 and master, not yet landed in stable, is in 3.10

## NavigationDrawer indicator overlay does not use shape
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7.</Error>
If the `NavigationDrawer` shape is modified via `indicatorShape` by widget or theme, from its default M3 `StadiumBorder` shape, the indicator correctly gets the new shape, but `InkWell` used by overlay color for focus, hover and pressed state do not use the specified shape. For more information, see issue [#123324](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123324), it has a merged fix in master via [PR #123325](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/123325).

## TabBar bottom divider, in M3, does not use its theme property color value
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to stable Flutter 3.7.</Error>
The `dividerColor` in the `TabBarThemeData` was never applied to the used divider on the bottom of the `TabBar` that is part of the [M3 spec](https://m3.material.io/components/tabs/specs). It was used when passed via widget `dividerColor`, but ignored when set via `TabBarThemeData`. There is no report submitted for this issue. The fix was added in master without any reported issue, or at least there is no linked issue. Has a **fix** [PR #119690](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/119690) in beta 3.10 and master, is now in stable 3.10.

## UnderlineInputBorder missing equality property
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7 and earlier.</Error>
ShapeBorder on input decorator `UnderlineInputBorder` has gaps in its equality operator and hashCode in Flutter SDK, it is missing the borderRadius property. See [issue #118282](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/118282).

This can be seen in the **Themes Playground** app where changing the controller value borderRadius on the used `UnderlineInputBorder` property does not trigger a rebuild of the Theme via Listenable in the AnimatedBuilder, since the value change is not observed because the property is not included in the object equality. Equality remains true, even though one of its property values has changed. Has a **fix** [PR #118284](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/118284) in master, is now in 3.10 stable.

## BottomAppBar background color cannot be changed in M3
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to stable Flutter 3.7.</Error>
The background color of the `BottomAppBar` cannot be changed when enabling Material-3 in Flutter. This applies to using its color property, theme, and any other means of trying to change its background color. This is bug in Flutter 3.7. There is a fix [PR #117082](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/117082) in the master channel. It is from December 16, 2022, but it did not get included in the Flutter 3.7 Jan 25, 2023 release. The issue is also reported in the FlexColorScheme repo here [FCS #115](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/issues/115).
Has a **fix** [PR #117082](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/117082) in master, is now in 3.10 stable.

## BottomAppBar incorrectly has a shadow in M3, should not have based on M3 spec
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7.</Error>
The `BottomAppBar` does not match M3 spec, it incorrectly has a shadow. See issue [#118150](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/118150).
Has a **fix** [PR #121406](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/121406) in master, is in 3.10.

## BottomSheet incorrectly has a shadow in M3, should not have based on M3 spec
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7.</Error>
The `BottomSheet` incorrectly has a shadow in M3 mode. See issue [#118244](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/118244). Has a **fix** [PR #121406](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/121406) in master, is in 3.10.

## SliverAppBar medium and large can not set foreground color
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.10.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.7 and earlier.</Error>
When defining `foregroundColor` for the new Material-3 style `SliverAppBar.large` or `SliverAppBar.medium` either via an `AppBarTheme` or their properties, the defined color is not getting applied to the `AppBar`as it should. See issue [#110951](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/110951). Has a **fix** [PR #118322](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/118322) in master, is in 3.10.

## NavigationBar ink ripple moves with height changes (Regression)
<Success>**Fixed** via [PR #117473](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/117473) and cherry-picked via [CP #119553](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/119553) to 3.7.2.</Success>
<Error>Applies only to stable Flutter 3.7.0 and 3.7.1.</Error>
If you change the `NavigationBar` from M3 default value of 80 dp, the ink level moves up or down with same amount as the deviation from the default 80 dp height. See issue report and illustration here [FCS #114](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/issues/114) as well as in Flutter SDK issue [#117420](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/117420). The issue was caused by a regression in Flutter 3.7. It did not exist in Flutter 3.3 and earlier. It is also fixed in the current master channel via [PR 117473](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/117473).

## NavigationBar ink ripple does not follow M3 spec
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.7.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.3 and earlier.</Error>
The M3 `NavigationBar` has a Material-2 styled ink effects also when opting in on Material-3. This is not according to Material design specification. See issues [#113870](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/113870) and [#114618](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/114618) for more information. This issue was fixed via [PR #115499](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/115499).

## Typography switching causes a crash
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.7.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.3 and earlier.</Error>
The **Themes Playground** version 7, removes the previous extensive `Typography` change crash workaround. The `Typography` changes now also correctly lerp animate when the setting is toggled in the Themes Playground app.

Switching Typography dynamically in Flutter SDK ThemeData was broken for many years, see
issue [#103864](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/103864) for more information. If it was done and the error ignored, an app doing so eventually become unstable. A **fix** [PR #110870](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/110870) solved the issue and is included in Flutter 3.7 stable and later, but it is not available in the Flutter 3.3 stable channel.

Versions 5.0.0 to 6.1.2 of **Themes Playground** app contained a workaround to avoid issue [#103864](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/103864). The workaround was done by always using the 2021 Typography, and simulating 2018 Typography. This was implemented by using a custom `TextTheme` that made it look like the 2018 Typography was used when using the Material-2 theme mode. The Playground App actually always stayed in 2021 Typography, but it looked like it switched. Which it accomplished by applying a custom `TextTheme` to 2021 Typography, that made it look like the 2018 Typography was being used. Other FlexColorScheme example applications, avoided the issue by only using the M3 2021 Typography, and not even mimicking a switch between M2 and M3 Typography.

The above workaround was needed because the Playground app has toggles that switch Typography frequently, without the workaround it eventually crashed. With this workaround, it never switched Typography. It just looked like it did, but the app stayed in 2021 Typography all the time. The by Themes Playground generated ThemeData config use the actual real effective Typography. This was also fine, since an app using the theme would likely never switch used Typography. However, if it does, it will face the same issue as the Playground app did.


## AppBar icon theme is not respected (Regression)
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.7.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.3.0 to 3.3.10.</Error>
Regression: `AppBarTheme` properties `iconTheme` and `actionsIconTheme` are ignored when `useMaterial3` is true. This was not seen in Flutter stable 3.0.5, but is now in 3.3.0. See issue[#107305](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107305), that was fixed via [PR #108332](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/108332) in master. The fix did not land in Flutter 3.3.0, as mentioned in issue [#110878](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/110878) it regressed into stable 3.3 release, even though it was fixed in master 28 days before stable 3.3 release.

## Elevation issues when opting in on M3
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.7.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.3 and earlier.</Error>
The `TimePickerDialog` does however not yet have M3 support in Flutter 3.7. However, FCS 7.0 styles it correctly anyway, but the elevation can not be changed from its default value. The elevation property does not exist in Flutter 3.7 theme for `TimePickerDialog`, it does exist in master. The `TimePickerDialog` M3 implementation in master still has some issues, see [118657](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/118657), which is probably why it did not land in Flutter 3.7.

In Flutter 3.0 and 3.3, when opting in on `useMaterial3:true`, the `Material` widget and other SDK widgets built on it, gets no elevation when only the `elevation` property is defined. It is required to also define `shadowColor` and/or `surfaceTintColor` to get any elevation effect. When using the `Material` widget itself this is easy to address. However, widgets like `Drawer`, `PopupMenuButton`, `BottomNavigationBar`, `NavigationRail`, `Dialog`, `AlertDialog`, `TimePickerDialog`, `DatePickerDialog`, `MaterialBanner` and `BottomSheet` do not expose these `Material` properties and cannot be elevated.

The issue is reported and tracked here [#107190](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107190) and also mentioned in the `FlexColorScheme` repo here
[#54](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/issues/54). There are no good workarounds for using elevation on these widgets when `useMaterial3` is true. The options are to not use M3. However, if such elevations are important to your app design, one working fix is to wrap those widgets in a theme where `useMaterial3` is false, the rest of your app can still use it. This is a rather tedious workaround. Due to this current SDK `Material` elevation issue when `useMaterial3` is true, it is recommended to avoid opting in on Material-3 if correctly elevated Material on Dialogs, Drawers, BottomSheet and PopupMenuButton are critical for the app's design. Dialogs and Drawers use a scrim, so the issue was not so bas when using them, but it was very problematic on e.g. BottomSheet and PopupMenuButton. FlexColorScheme 6.1 release included a theme fix to apply elevation color to the themed backgrounds of these two widgets as a workaround this issue. This workaround has been removed in FlexColorScheme 7 and later as no longer needed in Flutter 3.7.

This [PR #110624](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/110624) addresses the default elevation issue for `Material`, but it is not yet available in Flutter 3.3. It also does not fully solve the poor dark mode `PopupMenuButton` style, that needs widget level support for it to work properly.


## Chip (vanilla) has no M3 style
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.7.</Success>
<Error>Applies to Flutter 3.3 and earlier.</Error>
The `Chip` theme in Flutter 3.3 does not M3 style the plain vanilla `Chip`. A proposal to fix this can be tracked via issue [#109470](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/109470). This issue has been fixed in the master channel via [PR #111597](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/111597), but it never landed in the 3.3 stable releases.

## System Navigation Bar issue on A11 (Android)
<Success>Fixed in Flutter 3.7.</Success>
<Info>FlexColorScheme 7.0.0 has removed past used workaround it used to correct the issue on Android 11. It also again enabled the divider option in its `FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar`.</Info>
Due to Flutter SDK [issue #100027](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/100027) *"Using systemNavigationBarDividerColor changes statusBarIconBrightness and systemNavigationBarIconBrightness on Android 11"*, two temporary changes had been made to `FlexColorScheme.themedSystemNavigationBar` implementation:
* The divider feature was disabled (until the issue was solved).
* A temporary workaround implemented for Android 11. It managed to keep system icons from getting the wrong brightness on Android 11 by calling systemChrome twice.

The temporary changes were reverted by FlexColorScheme version 7. Other related issues on the Android System Navigation Bar topic worth tracking is the umbrella issue "System Navigation Bar APIs are Confusing" [#112301](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/112301).


## TextField in Material-3 has the wrong hovered and focused styles
<Success>Only occurred temporarily in master 3.7. Never landed in any stable Flutter version</Success>
When opting in on Material-3, `TextField` gets wrong `focused` and `hovered` styles in some states. See issue [#113329](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/113329) for details. The [PR #113776](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/113776) in the master channel fixes the issue. This issue only occurred in the master channel, because M3 mode support for `TextField` did not exist in the Flutter stable 3.3 channel. This issue never regressed to the stable channel.
