# Ways to ThemeData

In this chapter we compare different ways to define and create a `ThemeData`
object and look at the differences we get in effective **colors** in the theme-
We will look at using these ways, in both light and dark mode, dark is just
not mentioned below, it go too long:

1. ThemeData.light() and ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.light)
2. ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue)
3. ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch())
4. ThemeData.from(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch())
5. ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme())
6. ThemeData.from(colorScheme: ColorScheme())
7. ThemeData(colorSchemeSeed: Color()),
8. ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Color())),
9. ThemeData.from(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Color())),
10. FlexThemeData.light/dark(colorScheme)
11. FlexThemeData.light/dark(colorScheme, keyColors)
12. FlexThemeData.light/dark(colorScheme, keyColors, subThemesData)

We will compare the results and discuss findings. Yes that's a lot of methods
to make a `ThemeData` object. Last three ones are **FlexColorScheme** ways
with some different parameters. Recommendations on what to use when will also
be given.

## Reference Scheme

To make it interesting we will use the `ColorScheme` M3 Guide Baseline as input
for a fully qualified `ColorScheme`. We will however use the `FlexColorScheme`
input colors version, that has less colorful onColors as a starting point. When we
use seeded ColorSchemes with it, we will also get the more colorful colors as
specified in the M3 guide.

This is scheme is helpful for this study, because when we use its main color as
seed color, the M3 algorithm actually produces the same `ColorScheme` as the
full M3 guide spec version of this ColorScheme. This happens because the
colors used in the guide design M3 Baseline `ColorScheme`, have been produced
using the same input Color and same algorithm. This helps us spot differences
in the result easier, since we will not be focused on the color generation
differences, but rather on where the colors end up in the produced `ThemeData`.


For reference, here is the used M3 baseline light theme mode `ColorScheme` without
M3 colorful onColors.

```dart
const ColorScheme flexSchemeLight = ColorScheme(
  brightness: Brightness.light,
  primary: Color(0xff6750a4),
  onPrimary: Color(0xffffffff),
  primaryContainer: Color(0xffeaddff),
  onPrimaryContainer: Color(0xff000000),
  secondary: Color(0xff625b71),
  onSecondary: Color(0xffffffff),
  secondaryContainer: Color(0xffe8def8),
  onSecondaryContainer: Color(0xff000000),
  tertiary: Color(0xff7d5260),
  onTertiary: Color(0xffffffff),
  tertiaryContainer: Color(0xffffd8e4),
  onTertiaryContainer: Color(0xff000000),
  error: Color(0xffb00020),
  onError: Color(0xffffffff),
  errorContainer: Color(0xfffcd8df),
  onErrorContainer: Color(0xff000000),
  outline: Color(0xff4d4d4d),
  background: Color(0xffffffff),
  onBackground: Color(0xff000000),
  surface: Color(0xffffffff),
  onSurface: Color(0xff000000),
  surfaceVariant: Color(0xffffffff),
  onSurfaceVariant: Color(0xff000000),
  inverseSurface: Color(0xff121212),
  onInverseSurface: Color(0xffffffff),
  inversePrimary: Color(0xfff0e9ff),
  shadow: Color(0xff000000),
);
```

And here the dark theme mode one without M3 colorful onColors.

```dart
const ColorScheme flexSchemeDark = ColorScheme(
  brightness: Brightness.dark,
  primary: Color(0xffd0bcff),
  onPrimary: Color(0xff000000),
  primaryContainer: Color(0xff4f378b),
  onPrimaryContainer: Color(0xffffffff),
  secondary: Color(0xffccc2dc),
  onSecondary: Color(0xff000000),
  secondaryContainer: Color(0xff4a4458),
  onSecondaryContainer: Color(0xffffffff),
  tertiary: Color(0xffefb8c8),
  onTertiary: Color(0xff000000),
  tertiaryContainer: Color(0xff633b48),
  onTertiaryContainer: Color(0xffffffff),
  error: Color(0xffcf6679),
  onError: Color(0xff000000),
  errorContainer: Color(0xffb1384e),
  onErrorContainer: Color(0xffffffff),
  outline: Color(0xffb3b3b3),
  background: Color(0xff121212),
  onBackground: Color(0xffffffff),
  surface: Color(0xff121212),
  onSurface: Color(0xffffffff),
  surfaceVariant: Color(0xff121212),
  onSurfaceVariant: Color(0xffffffff),
  inverseSurface: Color(0xffffffff),
  onInverseSurface: Color(0xff000000),
  inversePrimary: Color(0xff635b70),
  shadow: Color(0xff000000),
);
```

The above enables easy copy/paste of them for verification. To show the colors
we can use our IDE of choice that show the colors too.

 The older `ThemeData` creation methods are `ColorSwatch` based, or actually
 `MaterialColor` based, a super class of `ColorSwatch`. We cannot use a
 `ColorScheme` to create themes from the above `ColorScheme` and there is
 no built-in `MaterialColor` swatch that is directly similar to the purple
 based Material 3 Baseline `ColorScheme`.

 FlexColorScheme and FlexColorPicker both contain a helper that can create a
 `MaterialColor` swatch from a single selected color. The algorithm is very simple,
 it is not the actual `MaterialColor` used to create the built in colors.
 Its results depend a lot on the used color, as it assume the provided color
 is the mid-point 500 shade. We can use the light theme mode primary color from
 the above `ColorScheme` and create a `MaterialColor` swatch from it.

 <img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme_docs/blob/master/docs/images/fcs-v5-wt-00-c-swatch.png?raw=true" alt="Flex purple swatch"/>

 What does this custom `MaterialColor` look like? The `FlexColorPicker` in
 the **Themes Playground** app can show it to us. Copy the "M3 Baseline" theme
 to the customizable theme and then select the primary color, having color value
 **0xff6750a4**. With this color selected, the wheel picker will draw a
 **Material Color** swatch created using this color, using the same
 `createPrimarySwatch` function. Below it you will also see the primary
 tonal palette for the same input color.

### Swatch Based

Let's call this group of themes **Swatch** based, since they all either
directly or under the hood via defaults, use the old `MaterialColor`
color swatches as base to create `ThemeData` and its colors.

These methods are practically obsolete when it comes to producing
`ColorScheme` based `ThemeData`. Some of them don't even accept a
`ColorScheme` as input, nor do they produce an app with a very
usable `ColorScheme`.
The methods are not deprecated, but it is stated in code comments that
these are not the preferred way to make color correct `ThemeData`. Let's
find out why they are not recommend.

### 1) TD.light

Since these methods do not accept a `ColorScheme` as input, we will use
`MaterialColor` swatch as input, and we will use our custom `flexSwatch`, in
some comparisons too when possible.

We start with theme methods `ThemeData.light()` and `ThemeData.dark()`. These
are just small Flutter SDK convenience factories based on this:

```dart
  /// A default light blue theme.
  factory ThemeData.light() => ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.light);
  /// A default dark theme with a teal secondary [ColorScheme] color.
  factory ThemeData.dark() => ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.dark);
```

These shortcuts are in fact only marginally shorter than using the syntax used
for what they return. It is a bit unclear why they even exits, but they do.
They are not very practical when you make a `ThemeData` object, since you
cannot define any other properties for them directly. You would have to apply
all of them with `copyWith`, if we create our `ThemeData` like this:

```dart
// 1a) TD.light
//     ThemeData.light() / ThemeData.light().dark()
title: '1a) TD.light',
theme: ThemeData.light(),
darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
```

All we can get with the above is the default `MaterialColor` which is
`Colors.blue` and a `ThemeData` based on it. Not very practical,
this theme is of course going to be identical to:

```dart
// 1b) TD brightness
//     ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.light)
//     ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.dark)
title: '1b) TD brightness',
theme: ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.light),
darkTheme: ThemeData(brightness: Brightness.dark),
```

Except with the above syntax we could have specified any of `ThemeData`'s myriad
other properties, to actually make a useable `ThemeData`object.

### 2) TD primarySwatch

We could e.g. have specified a swatch. Let's do that, using both the above blue
and our custom `flexSwatch` and see what that gives us.

```dart
// 2) TD primarySwatch
//    ThemeData(brightness: ..., primarySwatch: Colors.blue)
title: '3) TD primarySwatch',
theme: ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.light,
  primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
),
darkTheme: ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.dark,
  primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
),
```

If we use the `Colors.blue` as input it will still be identical to 1 and 2.
All using our `flexSwatch` as input will give us, is a variation with a
different color, but let's do it anyway so we can compare it later to its
`ColorScheme` based versions.

```dart
// 2) TD primarySwatch
//    ThemeData(brightness: ..., primarySwatch: flexSwatch)
title: '3) TD primarySwatch',
theme: ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.light,
  primarySwatch: flexSwatch,
),
darkTheme: ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.dark,
  primarySwatch: flexSwatch,
),
```

### 3) TD colorScheme.fromSwatch

We can also make a `ThemeData` with a `ColorScheme` that is created from
a `MaterialColor` swatch. Let's try this with `Colors.blue` and our
`flexSwatch` as well, and see if we can spot any differences in the result.

```dart
// 3) TD colorScheme.fromSwatch
//    ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(...))
//
title: '3) TD colorScheme.fromSwatch',
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue // or flexSwatch
    brightness: Brightness.light,
  ),
),
darkTheme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue // or flexSwatch
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
  ),
),
```

### 4) TD colorScheme.fromSwatch

Here is a complex combo, let's use factory `ThemeData.from` a `ColorScheme`
that is created from a `MaterialColor` made with `ColorScheme.fromSwatch`.
Let's see this with `Colors.blue` and our `flexSwatch` as well, and see if
we can now spot any differences in the result now.

```dart
// 4) TD.from scheme.fromSwatch
//    ThemeData.from(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(...))
//
title: '4) TD.from fromSwatch',
theme: ThemeData.from(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // or flexSwatch
    brightness: Brightness.light,
  ),
),
darkTheme: ThemeData.from(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // or flexSwatch
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
  ),
),
```

## Comparing 1 to 4

Let's now compare and analyze the different results.

 The results above show that options 1, 2 and 3 are all identical. They all also
 share the same problems:

 * ColorScheme colors in light mode all have same blue 500 color.
 * In dark mode we get a default magic teal color, that we did not specify,
   because it is the default. We are going to see this teal color stick around
   a lot in dark themes later too.
 * The dark mode does not look very good, it is grey, not really dark. This is
   because this Flutter dark mode implementation was made before there was a
   proper dark theme in the Material Design.
 * ColorScheme background in light theme mode color has the wrong contrasting
   onColor. This is bad, and probably a bug, or at least an oversight.
   Why does it get this color?

We can track the wrong `onBackground` from `ThemeData` and see that if we have
not passed in a `colorScheme` to it, it will be created with
`colorScheme ??= ColorScheme.fromSwatch` and in it
we find the issue, which is explained in the commented Flutter SDK code below:

```dart
// Create a color scheme from a [MaterialColor] swatch.
//
// This constructor is used by [ThemeData] to create its default
// color scheme.
factory ColorScheme.fromSwatch({
  MaterialColor primarySwatch = Colors.blue,
  Color? primaryColorDark,
  Color? accentColor,
  Color? cardColor,
  Color? backgroundColor,
  Color? errorColor,
  Brightness brightness = Brightness.light,
}) {
  assert(primarySwatch != null);
  assert(brightness != null);
  final bool isDark = brightness == Brightness.dark;
  // This is key for the issue, checking if primary needs white or black
  // onColor here is fine for index 500 and the actual primary color:
  final bool primaryIsDark = _brightnessFor(primarySwatch) == Brightness.dark;
  final Color secondary = accentColor ?? (isDark ? Colors.tealAccent[200]! : primarySwatch);
  final bool secondaryIsDark = _brightnessFor(secondary) == Brightness.dark;
  return ColorScheme(
    primary: primarySwatch,
    primaryVariant: primaryColorDark ?? (isDark ? Colors.black : primarySwatch[700]!),
    secondary: secondary,
    secondaryVariant: isDark ? Colors.tealAccent[700]! : primarySwatch[700]!,
    surface: cardColor ?? (isDark ? Colors.grey[800]! : Colors.white),
    // However, here primary swatch 200 is assigned to ColorScheme background.
    background: backgroundColor ?? (isDark ? Colors.grey[700]! : primarySwatch[200]!),
    error: errorColor ?? Colors.red[700]!,
    onPrimary: primaryIsDark ? Colors.white : Colors.black,
    onSecondary: secondaryIsDark ? Colors.white : Colors.black,
    onSurface: isDark ? Colors.white : Colors.black,
    // Here the onBackground gets white or black color, but that does not work
    // because the primaryIsDark boolean is used. That check was for
    // swatch color 500, the swatch color 200 that was used in light mode for
    // background typically does not have the same brightness as the 500 index,
    // so for most swatches we get the wrong contrasting color for onBackground
    // with all these .fromSwatch based ColorScheme creation methods. You would
    // have to know this and correct with a copyWith.
    //
    // Also the swatch does have a lot of nice shades that could be used to
    // set better colors for all the other ColorScheme container colors too
    // but it is chose not too, for backwards compatibility presumably.
    onBackground: primaryIsDark ? Colors.white : Colors.black,
    onError: isDark ? Colors.black : Colors.white,
    brightness: brightness,
  );
}
```

What about the 4th option, in it we are using the recommended way of creating
a `ThemeData`, by using `ThemeData.from` a `ColorScheme`.

This sounds good in theory, but since we are making
the `ColorScheme` using the broken or at least fidelity wise very poor
`ColorScheme.fromSwatch` factory, we will have the same issue with the background's
`onBackground` color in light mode.

However, now it gets even funkier.
Since `ThemeData.from` will assign many colors from the `ColorScheme` to
theme colors in `ThemeData`, that are the ones still used on actual surfaces
and background we get "interesting" result. In it `ColorScheme.surface` is
assigned to `ThemeData.cardColor` and both `ThemeData.CanvasColor` and
`scaffoldBackgroundColor` get the `ColorScheme.background`, which is
primarySwatch index 200 shade, it is a bit too much color on those
surfaces, not even M3 puts this much color on background surfaces, nor any
of **FlexColorScheme**'s surface blends.

## Comparing 2 to 4 with Custom Swatch

Here are also the results of using our custom `flexSwatch`, comparing it to
the default blue one. The results are naturally the same if we compare to
corresponding method using the default blue swatch, it is just using
another color for the swatch.

What is interesting to see in both cases, is that we get our swatch colors
assigned to `ThemeData` colors `primaryColorLight`, `primaryColorDark` and
`secondaryHeaderColor` in light theme mode only if we assign the swatch
to `ThemeData.primarySwatch` when using the `ThemeData` factory.

Let's move on to using `ColorScheme` to make `ColorScheme` based themes as we
should. Then all will be perfect, right?

## Scheme Based

Making `ThemeData` colors by defining a `ColorScheme` is the recommend way today.
But there are many way to make `ThemeData` with `ColorScheme` as well.

What are their differences? Let's take a look at that.

Now we switch from
using the `MaterialColor` swatch as input to the `flexSchemeLight` light and
`flexSchemeDark` dark `ColorScheme` we defined based on the M3 baseline scheme.

### 5) TD colorscheme

The simplest way is to just use `ThemeData` with a fully specified `ColorScheme`,
like so:

```dart
// 5) TD colorScheme
//    ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme(...))
//
title: '5) TD colorscheme',
theme: ThemeData(colorScheme: flexSchemeLight),
darkTheme: ThemeData.from(colorScheme: flexSchemeDark),
```

### 6) TD.from colorScheme

Does it matter if we use the `ThemeData.from` a `ColorScheme` factory like so:

```dart
// 6) TD.from colorScheme
//    ThemeData.from(colorScheme: ColorScheme(...))
//
title: '6) TD.from colorScheme',
theme: ThemeData.from(colorScheme: flexSchemeLight),
darkTheme: ThemeData.from(colorScheme: flexSchemeDark),
```

### 7) TD colorSchemeSeed

If we want to make a seeded `ColorScheme`, we can use the `ThemeData` property
`colorSchemeSeed` to do so. Here we are using the `ColorScheme.primary` color
value from our `flexSchemeLight` scheme, as seed color for both the seed
generated light and dart `ColorScheme`.

You should use the same seed color
for your light and dark theme if you want the light and dark `ColorScheme`
to use the identical generated tonal palettes, with the appropriate tones
for light and dark themes mapped to the generated `ColorScheme`.

```dart
// 7) TD colorSchemeSeed
//    ThemeData(colorSchemeSeed: Color(...))
//
title: '7) TD colorSchemeSeed',
theme: ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.light,
  colorSchemeSeed: const Color(0xff6750a4),
),
darkTheme: ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.dark,
  colorSchemeSeed: const Color(0xff6750a4),
),
```

### 8) TD scheme.fromSeed

Is the above any different from using creating your `ThemeData` using
a `ColorScheme.fromSeed`?

```dart
// 8) TD scheme.fromSeed
//    ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(...))
//
title: '8) TD scheme.fromSeed',
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color(0xff6750a4),
    brightness: Brightness.light,
  ),
),
darkTheme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color(0xff6750a4),
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
  ),
),
```

### 9) TD.from fromSeed

Or what about using `ThemeData.from` with a `ColorScheme.fromSeed`, like so:

```dart
// 9) TD.from scheme.fromSeed
//    ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(...))
//
title: '9) TD.from fromSeed',
theme: ThemeData.from(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color(0xff6750a4),
    brightness: Brightness.light,
  ),
),
darkTheme: ThemeData.from(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color(0xff6750a4),
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
  ),
),
```

If all these options feel confusing, it is because because they are.
But let's now look at all the results, excluding option 9, we will look at it
in the next group of comparisons.

### 5) Analysis - ThemeData made with a ColorScheme

**Option 5** with a `ThemeData` from a full `ColorScheme` looks as can be expected,
we have our `ColorScheme` in the scheme as given. However, none of the scheme
colors have been assigned to any of the direct colors in our `ThemeData`, and
since those colors are still used by a number UI elements it is a bit problematic.

### 6) Analysis - ThemeData.from a ColorScheme

With **option 6** using `ThemeData.from` with our full `ColorScheme`, things are
as good as they will get in Flutter SDK, when it comes to getting reasonable
colors, assigned to legacy colors in `ThemeData`. We can see that in light mode
`primaryColor` got the `ColorScheme.primary` color and `ToggleableColor` got
the `ColorScheme.secondary` color, not a very nice color in this particular
scheme, but the assignment is appropriate and correct. We also see that the error
color got copied over to ThemeData's error color. This applies to Canvas, Scaffold, Card
and many other colors too. We can take a look into the `ThemeData.from` factory
to get the full scoop of what it does:

```dart
factory ThemeData.from({
  required ColorScheme colorScheme,
  TextTheme? textTheme,
}) {
  final bool isDark = colorScheme.brightness == Brightness.dark;
  // For surfaces that use primary color in light themes and surface color in dark
  final Color primarySurfaceColor = isDark ? colorScheme.surface : colorScheme.primary;
  final Color onPrimarySurfaceColor = isDark ? colorScheme.onSurface : colorScheme.onPrimary;
  return ThemeData(
    colorScheme: colorScheme,
    brightness: colorScheme.brightness,
    primaryColor: primarySurfaceColor,
    primaryColorBrightness: ThemeData.estimateBrightnessForColor(primarySurfaceColor),
    canvasColor: colorScheme.background,
    accentColor: colorScheme.secondary,
    accentColorBrightness: ThemeData.estimateBrightnessForColor(colorScheme.secondary),
    scaffoldBackgroundColor: colorScheme.background,
    bottomAppBarColor: colorScheme.surface,
    cardColor: colorScheme.surface,
    dividerColor: colorScheme.onSurface.withOpacity(0.12),
    backgroundColor: colorScheme.background,
    dialogBackgroundColor: colorScheme.background,
    indicatorColor: onPrimarySurfaceColor,
    errorColor: colorScheme.error,
    textTheme: textTheme,
    applyElevationOverlayColor: isDark,
  );
}
```

The `accentColor`, `accentColorBrightness` and even `primaryColorBrightness`
that `ThemeData.from` still sets are actually deprecated, but presumably
still being defined for backwards compatibility reasons. If we look
closely we see that in light theme mode, we get got `colorScheme.secondary` on
the `ThemeData.toggleableActiveColor`, but not in dark mode. Does this matter?

Yes it does, because the `toggleableActiveColor` is still used as default color
by on/off type UI switches and toggles. In dark theme mode that is now a teal color,
so they will get a teal color that has nothing with our `ColorScheme`, unless
we apply it to it separately. But why did it get the `secondary` color in light
theme mode and not in dark theme mode? After all it is not even assigned any
value in `ThemeData.from`. This happens because `ThemeData` itself does this:

```dart
toggleableActiveColor ??= isDark ? Colors.tealAccent[200]!
                                 : (accentColor ?? primarySwatch[600]!);
```

It is understandable that this logic was kept for all the swatch based
themes and their backwards compatibility, but why could `ThemeData.from` not
include a line that set:

```dart
toggleableActiveColor: colorScheme.secondary,
```

If done along with setting `accentColor`, back when it was introduced, it would
have been fine, and we would have had a slightly less confusing `ThemeData`
from a `ColorScheme` as a result. Perhaps it was an oversight, perhaps it was
deliberate and done for unknown reasons.

Next we have to wonder about three colors that `ThemeData.from` happily ignores
in light theme mode, and in dark theme mode makes them into something completely
different. As can be seen `primaryColorLight`, `primaryColorDark` and
`secondaryHeaderColor` are still the same blue in light theme mode, as when we
used swatch colors. This is because in `ThemeData` they by default get colors
from the swatch, that has not been assigned any value, so it in turn has
defaulted to `Colors.blue`, and consequently we get their blue colors here:

```dart
  primaryColorLight ??= isDark ? Colors.grey[500]! : primarySwatch[100]!;
  primaryColorDark ??= isDark ? Colors.black : primarySwatch[700]!;
  secondaryHeaderColor ??= isDark ? Colors.grey[700]! : primarySwatch[50]!;
```

There are still some UI elements that use these colors as their default colors
in Flutter SDK 2.10. This means they, like the switches in dark mode, now
use colors that have nothing to do with the `ColorScheme` we wanted our
application to have.

In dark mode we can see that all these colors are grey and even the
`ThemeData.primaryColor` is grey. This might be a bit confusing, since these
colors are not grey in our dark mode `ColorScheme`. Would it not be more
consistent if these colors were different shades of the primary color in dark
mode too? Like they are in light mode?

Why are they grey? My theory, in earlier version of Flutter's AppBar, the
only way to get the correct dark/grey color on it in dark theme mode, was if
this oddity was added to the factory:

```dart
// For surfaces that use primary color in light themes and surface color in dark
final Color primarySurfaceColor = isDark ? colorScheme.surface : colorScheme.primary;
final Color onPrimarySurfaceColor = isDark ? colorScheme.onSurface : colorScheme.onPrimary;
```

Today this is not needed, at least not for that reason anymore, newer
version of the `AppBar` has this behavior built-in without depending on
`ThemeData.primaryColor` and its brightness. But this old logic has not been
changed to make them consistent in relation the used `ColorScheme`,
most likely due to legacy compatibility reasons.

I wrote a long analysis and review about these inconsistences already back in
2020. Back then peculiarity had already existed for about year. If you are
curious, you can read about it in [issue 65782](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65782).

Some of the reported observations in the issue have since been addressed, by
the still on going `ThemeData` rework. While some parts, like the
`primaryColorLight` and `primaryColorDark` are not even yet mentioned on the
deprecation path, even though all other direct colors in `ThemeData`are.
The `ThemeData` color rework is tracked in umbrella [issue 91772](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91772).

In any case, the road forward is clear and things will get more consistent out
of the box, once all the tasks in [issue 91772](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91772)
are done and have landed in stable channel. As an example, `toggleableActiveColor`
has been deprecated, see [PR 95870](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/95870)
channel, there is a migration document prepared
[here](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/toggleable-active-color#migration-guide.).
This is not yet in stable channel 2.10, but might arrive in the next stable
release.

We are looking forward to the day when the entire `ThemeData` color confusion
is cleaned up.
Until then, we will see further below that **FlexColorScheme** can help you with
the inconsistences and give you a coherent color theme now.

On a related note, if you are interested in how the support for Material 3 is
coming along in Flutter, then this umbrella
[issue 91605](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91605)
is the one to track for that.

### ElevationOverlayColor

One thing the `ThemeData.from` factory has going for it in dark theme mode, is
that it correctly uses the ElevationOverlayColor in dark mode by setting
`applyElevationOverlayColor` to true when the theme brightness is dark:

```dart
applyElevationOverlayColor: true,
```

For dark themes, this is really something one should do in Material 2 design.
No other `ThemeData` factory turns this on by default, so if you are using them
you should make sure to set it to true for your dark theme.

Material 3 color system uses a new elevation color overlay algorithm that is
not yet available in Flutter 2.10 stable channel, see
[issue 91607](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91607). In Material 3 an elevation
color overlay is used in both light and dark theme mode. We will return
to looking at it when in lands in stable channel. In this
[PR 100036](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/100036) you can learn and
see what it does. Surfaces get more colored tinted when they are elevated, and you
can do elevation with tint, shadow or both.

When working with elevation overlays in Material 2 it is important to know
that it should be applied to Material surfaces that might get elevated. These
surfaces might actually be using the `ColorScheme.surface` color, which may even
be in the form of `ThemeData.cardColor` on the surface or
`ColorScheme.background`, which again might be in the form of
`ThemeData.canvasColor` this all depends on how the actual Material surface UI
elements implements their default surface/background color, and they do vary.
However, surfaces will only get an elevation overlay color if the color value
is equal to `ColorScheme.surface`, an implementation oversight perhaps, in
the sense that it assumes they are all equal.

When you are working with blended surfaces, where `surface` and `background`
may differ, this matters. Typically with default Flutter SDK values, these colors
all share the same color value, so the issue won't be noticed. In
**FlexColorScheme** they may be different. FlexColorScheme addresses this issue
by mostly using `ColorScheme.surface` as the themed color for surfaces that
will typically be elevated, like Card and Dialogs. Dialogs otherwise defaults
to background.

Additionally if this is not enough, FlexColorScheme offers blend modes where
surface and background always get the same blend strength, keeping their color values
identical. You can read more about this implementation
oversight here in [issue #90353](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/90353).
Where it is analyzed and solution suggested that would remedy it.
It is unlikely to ever be addressed, so the best thing to do is to
be aware of it, and design around it when so needed for the dark theme design.

### 7 Analysis - ThemeData made with colorSchemeSeed color

This one is surprising when it comes to the outline color. The new
`ColorScheme.outline` color is intended to be used on UI elements having a
design that calls for an outline. This is used e.g. on the new M3
[Chips design](https://m3.material.io/components/chips/overview), the
[Outlined button](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview) even
[Card](https://m3.material.io/components/cards/overview) comes with a new
outlined option.

However, it is doubtful that this color should be applied directly as is
to the current `ThemeData.dividerColor`. Most likely it should indeed be
this color, but with same or similar opacity as before. Which we get
when we use options 8 and 9. The reason why this demo started looking very weird
with this theme is because the divider color is used for dividers on the custom
rail and a rail side border, and also used for what was a very faint border
around the color boxes.

The divider color is not mentioned in the Material 3 guide, yet at least,
but e.g. on the [menu design](https://m3.material.io/components/menus/overview)
we can see a divider. It is not using the outline color directly, as it would be
much stronger. It is perhaps the same color, but with same alpha as before
(0x1F), could be some new opacity value too.
This current divider color is perhaps an oversight with this theme
creation method. If you use it you should add alpha 0x1F to
`ThemeData.dividerColor`.

When it comes to the ThemeData colors, `primaryColor`, `primaryColorLight` and
`primaryColorDark`, plus the `toggleableActiveColor` in dark mode, things are
as poorly supported as mentioned in previous analysis of them.

### 8 Analysis - ThemeData made with a ColorScheme.fromSeed

As with previous case where a ThemeData is made from a `ColorScheme` the
scheme is fine, it is just that we do not get any sensible color assignments
from it on our direct `ThemeData` colors. It is the same situation of course,
just another way to make a `ColorScheme`, a fancy way. The colors we get in
the `ColorScheme` are quite pretty, although the dull and grey like secondary
color is not so good on switches, but that is just this particular scheme.

## FlexColoScheme Based

Next we will compare all the above to what **FlexColoScheme** produces with same
`ColorScheme` setup. A little known feature, we can use a fully
specified `ColorScheme` as input to `FlexColorScheme` to create custom
themes based on them too.

This can be used instead of the `colors` property. The `colors` property is
convenient, since we do not have to specify all the colors in a `ColorScheme`.
When using it FlexColorScheme will handle the nuances of making one, based on
other properties we specify in the factory, like blends, app bar setup, etc.
Using defaults and computational colors it will make its own version of a fully
specified `ColorScheme` when it produces its `ThemeData`. Using key colors for
seed generated `ColorScheme` is another computational `ColorScheme`
generation method.

### 10) FTD.light(colorScheme)

In this case we want to use the exact same input `ColorScheme` as before, so
we can compare the results with the standard `ColorScheme` based
`ThemeData` creation methods we used above.

We can do that by using the same input `ColorScheme`. Thus we again use
the `flexSchemeLight` and `flexSchemeDark` we defined earlier, but now in our
`FlexColorScheme` setup:

```dart
// 10) FTD.light(colorScheme)
//    FlexThemeData.light(colorScheme:...),
//    FlexThemeData.dark(colorScheme:...),
//
title: '10) FTD.light(colorScheme)',
theme: FlexThemeData.light(colorScheme: flexSchemeLight),
darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(colorScheme: flexSchemeDark),
```

In case it was not obvious, earlier above **TD** was used as short for
`ThemeData` to fit on the AppBar and here we use **FTD** as short for
`FlexThemeData`.

### 11) FTD.light(keyColors)

Next, we use the identical seed generated `ColorScheme` as above, when we
used `ColorScheme.fromSeed`. We do that by turning on using keyColors, we just
pass in the default setup, which by default uses the primary color and the same
algorithm that the `ColorScheme.fromSeed` used when we used it with
the `primary` color from our `ColorScheme`.

```dart
// 11) FTD.light(keyColors)
//    FlexThemeData.light(colorScheme:..., keyColors: ...),
//    FlexThemeData.dark(colorScheme:..., keyColors: ...),
//
title: '11) FTD.light(keyColors)',
theme: FlexThemeData.light(
  colorScheme: flexSchemeLight,
  keyColors: const FlexKeyColors(),
),
darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
  colorScheme: flexSchemeDark,
  keyColors: const FlexKeyColors(),
),
```
### 12) FTD.light(key sub)

Finally we will enable the opinionated component sub-themes, however to not
get stuck on the differences in border radius and shape of the FAB, and custom
text theme, let's make it look like Material 2 for this comparison.

```dart
// 12) FTD.light(key sub)
//    FlexThemeData.light(colorScheme:..., keyColors: ...),
//    FlexThemeData.dark(colorScheme:..., keyColors: ...),
//
title: '12) FTD.light(key sub)',
theme: FlexThemeData.light(
  colorScheme: flexSchemeLight,
  keyColors: const FlexKeyColors(),
  subThemesData: const FlexSubThemesData(
    defaultRadius: 4,
    fabUseShape: false,
    useTextTheme: false,
  ),
),
darkTheme: FlexThemeData.dark(
  colorScheme: flexSchemeDark,
  keyColors: const FlexKeyColors(),
  subThemesData: const FlexSubThemesData(
    defaultRadius: 4,
    fabUseShape: false,
    useTextTheme: false,
  ),
),
```

### 9 Analysis - ThemeData.from a ColorScheme.fromSeed

This is the best result we will get with Flutter's current built-in theming.
As with previous cases we get a `ThemeData` that is mostly well made from a
`ColorScheme`, where the scheme is fine, but as before we do not get any scheme
based color assignments on the `ThemeData` colors `primaryColorLight` and
`primaryColorDark`, or the `secondaryHeaderColor` in light theme mode.

As can be seen `primaryColorLight`, `primaryColorDark` and
`secondaryHeaderColor` are still the same blue in light theme mode, as when we
used swatch colors, because in `ThemeData` they by default get colors
from the swatch, that has not been assigned any value, so it in turn has
defaulted to `Colors.blue` hence their blue shades.

In dark theme mode, the peculiar grey-scales on `primaryColor`,
`primaryColorLight`, `primaryColorDark` and `secondaryHeaderColor` prevail.
As does the teal color on the `toggleableActiveColor`, instead of the
`colorScheme.Secondary` that is should have in a ColorScheme based theme by
default.

If you use this theming method and plan to use the above colors, you may prefer
to give the `ColorScheme` appropriate override values using `copyWith`.

### 10 Analysis - FlexThemeData.light/dark(colorScheme)

This FlexColorScheme based theme made from the same `ColorScheme` as used in
the Flutter SDK examples earlier, has the closest equivalent in method Flutter
method 6.

We can see that it has no legacy `ThemeData` direct color properties that do
not follow the color design in the used `ColorScheme`, this applies to both
light and dark theme mode.

### 11 Analysis - FlexThemeData.light/dark((colorScheme, keyColors)

This FlexColorScheme based theme, made from the same `ColorScheme` as used in
the Flutter SDK examples above, and using its primary key as seed color to
generate a `ColorScheme` from tonal palettes. Using the same algorithm setup
as the only one offered out of the box by Flutter, has the closest equivalent
in method 9 above.

Again we can observe that it has no odd legacy `ThemeData`
direct color properties that do not follow the color design in the
used `ColorScheme`, and that it applies to both light and dark theme mode.

This scheme also uses a Material 3 seed generated `ColorScheme` that is
identical to the one produced by Flutter's only directly supported M3
`ColorScheme` generation algorithm. FlexColorScheme offers many ways to
modify and tune the algorithm.

### 12 Analysis FlexThemeData.light/dark(colorScheme, keyColors, subThemesData)

The produced `ColorScheme` from this setup is identical to method 11.

Again we can observe that it has no odd legacy `ThemeData`
direct color properties that do not follow the color design in the
used `ColorScheme`, this applies to both light and dark theme mode.

We can however see a difference in `ThemeData` on colors `disabledColor`,
`focusColor`, `hoverColor`, `highlightColor` and `splashColor`, they all
have a hint of `ColorScheme.primary` color on them as well.
This is an opinionated default that came when we enable and opted in on
using `FlexSubThemesData`.
It can be turned OFF and reverting it to `ThemeData` defaults, even when using
the sub-themes, this is done by setting its `interactionEffects` to false.

```dart
  subThemesData: const FlexSubThemesData(interactionEffects: false),
```

Many sub-themes have their own state theming that define the hover, disabled,
ink etc. effects, when using the sub-themes, like e.g. all the Material
buttons do, and even `ToggleButtons` does.

The interaction and state effects colors in `ThemeData` are the default ones
used by widgets when their own theme do not define them. These colors are also
on the previously mentioned deprecation path in Flutter, and will eventually be
moved into a component theme or several different component themes.

### Recommendation

How should we create our theme when using vanilla Flutter theming to get
a modern `ColorScheme` based theme?

As shown above, the simplest approach is to use the `ThemeData.from` factory,
with whatever `ColorScheme` we have defined.

The drawback with this methods is that not all colors in `ThemeData` will get
colors matching our `ColorScheme`. Additionally we cannot define any component
themes in the same theme definition, nor adjust any of the direct color properties
in `ThemeData` that we may want to modify from their defaults where
`ThemeData.from` leaves gaps. We can of course apply all of these using
`copyWith`. When using `ThemeData.from` we should definitively do that.

The second option is to just use the big `ThemeData` factory. This gives us
access to all the properties in it and we can set and define them as we
please. As long as we are familiar with all its inner workings, this is fine
and not so difficult. I recommend starting with a setup the replicates what
the `ThemeData.from` factory does and adjusting it as desired. Let's take
a look at that:

```dart
// Assuming you have defined your `colorScheme`, we could do this:
ThemeData(
  colorScheme: colorScheme,
  brightness: colorScheme.brightness,
  // Prefer this for the `ThemeData.primaryColor`
  primaryColor: colorScheme.primary,
  // These we have to compute based based on our colorScheme primary color,
  // if we want to give them scheme matching values. Here is an example that
  // happens to be what FlexColorScheme does, but feel free to use what
  // you prefer:
  primaryColorLight: colorScheme.brightness == Brightness.dark
        ? Color.alphaBlend(Colors.black.withAlpha(0x72), colorScheme.primary)
        : Color.alphaBlend(Colors.black.withAlpha(0x66), colorScheme.primary),
  primaryColorDark: colorScheme.brightness == Brightness.dark
        ? Color.alphaBlend(Colors.white.withAlpha(0x59), colorScheme.primary)
        : Color.alphaBlend(Colors.white.withAlpha(0x66), colorScheme.primary),
  secondaryHeaderColor: colorScheme.brightness == Brightness.dark
        ? Color.alphaBlend(Colors.black.withAlpha(0x99), colorScheme.primary)
        : Color.alphaBlend(Colors.white.withAlpha(0xCC), colorScheme.primary),
  // These are deprecated, skip them:
  //   primaryColorBrightness: ThemeData.estimateBrightnessForColor(colorScheme.primary),
  //   accentColor: colorScheme.secondary,
  //   accentColorBrightness: ThemeData.estimateBrightnessForColor(colorScheme.secondary),
  // As long as `toggleableActiveColor` exists in ThemeData, do add this one:
  toggleableActiveColor: colorScheme.secondary,
  // Important background colors in ThemeData.
  // We can use other colors too, e.g. if we want some surface branding on
  // them then the above `alphaBlend` is the way to start adding them, not done
  // here now.
  scaffoldBackgroundColor: colorScheme.background,
  canvasColor: colorScheme.background,
  backgroundColor: colorScheme.background,
  cardColor: colorScheme.surface,
  bottomAppBarColor: colorScheme.surface,
  // For dialog prefer surface if your scheme background color is different from
  // surface, this ensures elevation color in dark mode on dialogs, when
  // applyElevationOverlayColor is true in dark mode.
  dialogBackgroundColor: colorScheme.surface,
  // Since we used Colorscheme.primary for primaryColor, this works, you may
  // need to adjust TabBar theme though depending on where you will use TabBars
  indicatorColor: colorScheme.onPrimary,
  dividerColor: colorScheme.onSurface.withOpacity(0.12),
  errorColor: colorScheme.error,
  // Set to true in dark mode
  applyElevationOverlayColor: colorScheme.brightness == Brightness.dark,
  // Add you your app's text theme here, or skip if default is OK.
  textTheme: myTextTheme,
  // Add all your custom component themes:
  appBarTheme: myAppBarTheme,
  tabBarTheme: myTabBarTheme,
  // as many as needed...
);
```

If we above for `ColorScheme` substitute it with our earlier defined
`flexSchemeLight` for our light theme, and `flexSchemeDark` for our
dark theme, and remove the `myTextTheme` and component themes. Then we can
try this custom `ThemeData` setup in the same demo app we used
for all the above cases.

Below we compare this to the FlexColorScheme case 10, which it with respect to
`ColorScheme` and `ThemeData` colors is equal to. Well FlexColorScheme has
no elevation by default on the AppBar, so it will be darker in dark theme mode,
but otherwise the colors are the same.

This kind of setup will ensure that all built-in widgets will get and use colors
that match your `ColorScheme` by default, not just the ones that have already
been migrated to use defaults from `ThemeData.colorScheme`.

As the migration and deprecation of `ThemeData` colors in Flutter SDK progresses,
the importance of doing this will become less important. In Flutter 2.10 stable
some widgets still depend e.g. on `primaryColorLight` and `primaryColorDark` as
their default colors, for example `CircleAvatar`. If you don't give them
`ColorScheme` derived values, they will use the default swatch theme based
colors.

Currently setting colors on all the background and surface colors from your
`ColorScheme`, in a similar manner to what `ThemeData.from` does is critical.
If you do not, you will may get background color defaults in dark theme
that are not the ones from your `ColorScheme.

This of course all requires that your `ColorScheme` uses correct background
colors and onColors. Use the built-in `ColorScheme.light` and `ColorScheme.dark`
factories for that, or even a `ColorScheme.fromSeed` as a base, and define you
custom colors in them as needed, to make your custom light and dark `ColorScheme`.

If all the above felt a bit verbose or complicated, then **FlexColorScheme** will
do all the above color setups for you. Plus it has surface blending and a more
versitale seed generated `ColorScheme`, and "a few" built-in `ColorScheme`s
that can be nice starting points too. To top it off, it can help you
with component theming as well.
